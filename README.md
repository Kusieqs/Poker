# Poker Project - Texas Hold'em

### Console version

The primary goal of this project was to explore and practice asynchronous methods, as well as to create a custom logger through an interface. While the project is functional, it is not fully polished or comprehensive. The core gameplay of Texas Hold'em poker is implemented and operational, but it has its limitations. Some of the game's rules have not been fully incorporated, and there are areas that could be improved. Despite these shortcomings, the project served its purpose as a learning exercise, particularly in understanding asynchronous programming techniques.
